# Connectame

## Motivation
Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico and destroyed the houses and disrupted the supply of energy, food, and water. The residents 
faced two main challenges. The organization who distributed the donated items could not ensure the donated items reached
the people who needed them, and the process of distributing the donated items was inefficient. 

## Summary
An Ionic app (adapted from a native Android app) that enables peer-to-peer donation transactions in Puerto Rico. 

This hybrid mobile app serves two main functions:
1. It guarantees the donated items reach the people who need them as the donor inputs the items he/she donates and his/her location, and the 
recepient inputs the items such as food and water he/she needs and his/her location. The app will match them and if a person is travelling from
the place of donor to recipient, it will notify the person the route to pick up the donated items and deliver the items to the
recepients.
2. It collects data about the locations of the recipients, and updates the organization which distributes the donated items about
the hubs where the organization can best distribute the donated items. It will also update the user where the hub is so the user
can go to the hub to collect the donated item.
